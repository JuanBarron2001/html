      <h2> Our Story </h2>
      <p>
        During the fall of 1985, Baltazar Mendoza-Madrigal began to explore the
        idea of establishing a Latino-based fraternity at the University of
        Iowa.  Having seen the impact organizations like Phi Beta Sigma
        Fraternity had on their constituency, Mendoza-Madrigal knew something
        similar could be done for the Latino interest.  Without knowing the
        impact he would have almost 30 years down the road, Baltazar starting
        doing research on this possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        After months of dedicated research, Mendoza-Madrigal called for a
        special meeting on March 7, 1986.  Held at the Chicano Indian American
        Cultural Center (now known as the Latino Native American Cultural
        Center), this meeting would bring together the Latino students to
        discuss the feasibility of creating a social fraternity that would
        focus on the Latino culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Latino community was divided among several social groups at the
        time,” said Mendoza-Madrigal.  The enthusiasm in favor of establishing
        a social fraternity that could help in unifying the community was so
        great that word started to spread quickly across the University of
        Iowa campus.  Everyone knew that something great was about to
        take place.  After much planning, the ideology and philosophy of this
        new organization were finalized on April 4th, 1986.  Henceforth, this
        day is recognized as the official founding date of Sigma Lambda Beta
        International Fraternity at The University of Iowa.
