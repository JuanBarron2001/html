      <p class="paragraph"> Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack
         limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together
         forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living
         hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various
         extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes,
         so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish
         are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the
         amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from
         within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is
         defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a
         formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in
         the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[1][2] The traditional term
         pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a
         phylogenetic classification. </p>
