      <h1> Megaladon </h1>
      <p class="paragraph"> Megalodon (Carcharocles megalodon), meaning
        "big tooth", is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately
        23 to 3.6 million years ago (mya), during the Early Miocene to the
        Pliocene. It was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae
        and a close relative of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).
        However, presently there is near unanimous consensus that it belongs to
        the extinct family Otodontidae, which diverged from the ancestry of the
        great white shark during the Early Cretaceous. Its genus placement is
        still debated, authors placing it in either Carcharocles, Megaselachus,
        Otodus, or Procarcharodon. This is because transitional fossils have
        been found showing that Megalodon is the final chronospecies of a
        lineage of giant sharks originally of the genus Otodus which evolved
        during the Paleocene. </p>
